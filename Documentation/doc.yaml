            # Public API Index _(Not yet exhaustive, not yet....)*_
            _Not including technical public methods which ones are used for very advanced use between components (typically if you extend Coondorcet or build your own modules)._

            _*: I try to update and complete the documentation. See also [the manual](https://github.com/julien-boudry/Condorcet/wiki), [the tests](../Tests) also produce many examples. And create issues for questions or fixing documentation!_
